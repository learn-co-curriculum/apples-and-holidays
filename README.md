# Apples and Holidays88

## Objectives

Get comfortable interating over arrays and hashes. This lab is broken into two sections: apple picker and holiday supplies.

## Apple Picker

### Instructions

In `lib/apple.rb` write two methods that will pick the apples out of the fruits array, one using `collect`, and the other using `select`.

```ruby
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "apple"]

apple_picker_with_select(fruits) #=> ["apple", "apple"]
```

**Important:** Think about the difference between `select` and `collect`. Which one makes more sense to use? What do you think the benefits are of using one over the other, in this case?

**Reminder:** You can `require 'pry'` on the top of your file and use binding.pry inside your methods. Then, when you run rspec, you'll be dropped right into the middle of the method. This will help you explore what is going one and understand how to get the tests passing. 

## The Holiday Suppliers

### Instructions

You have a bunch of decorations for various holidays organized by season.

```ruby
holiday_supplies = {
  :winter => {
    :christmas => ["Lights", "Wreath"],
    :new_years => ["Party Hats"]
  },
  :summer => {
    :fourth_of_july => ["Fireworks", "BBQ"]
  },
  :fall => {
    :thanksgiving => ["Turkey"]
  },
  :spring => {
    :memorial_day => ["BBQ"]
  }
}
```

Write your methods in `lib/holiday.rb`; use the comments in each method as guides.

* Write a method that returns the second supply for the Fourth of July. For eg:

```ruby
def second_supply_for_fourth_of_july(holiday_supplies)
  holiday_supplies[:summer][:fourth_of_july][1]
end
```

* Write a method that adds a supply to a Winter holiday.

* Write a method that adds a supply to Memorial Day.

* Write a method that adds a new holiday and its associated supplies to any season.

* Write a method to collect all Winter supplies from all the winter holidays. For eg:

```bash
winter_supplies(holiday_supplies) #=> ["Lights", "Wreath", etc]
```

* Write a method that uses a loop to list out all the supplies you have for each holiday and the season. Use string manipulation to get your output to match what the test is expecting. **Hint:** How do we convert symbols into strings? How can we convert an array into a string?


Output:

```
Winter:
  Christmas: Lights, Wreath
  New Years: Party Hats
```

* Write a method to collect all holidays with BBQ. The method should behave as seen below:

```bash
holidays_with_bbqs(holiday_supplies)
#=> [:fourth_of_july, :memorial_day]
```

**Reminder:** This is a challenging lab, so remember to use Pry, googling and the Learn community to help you get the tests passing.
